This is a fork of Mattias Kettner's mk_livestatus. It has been ported to
Nagios 4 and contains some extra features such as sorting and page offsets.
This branch is being maintained by op5 until such a time comes when everything
we need has been merged back upstream.

To install, run:
 autoreconf -s
 automake --add-missing
 ./configure CPPFLAGS=-I$(path to nagios include files, usually /usr/local/nagios/include)
 make
 sudo make install
